A fully featured Clinic Management System having a well designed Database Schema made as a final project for the course "Database Systems CS203" during my 4th Semester at [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences](http://nu.edu.pk/). Its based on the 3 Tier Architecture.

## Technologies Used:

For Frontend: HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript

For Backend: C#, ASP.NET

For Database: SQL

### Pre-requisites:

* [Microsoft SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express)
* [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017)

Patient selects a free slot of his choice and then sends request for that free slot to the doctor. The doctor will then approve/reject it.
* **6.	Notifications** ‚Äì In this tab, a notification is shown whenever the doctor accepts/rejects the requested appointment.
* **7.	Feedback** ‚Äì After a appointment is completed, patient can give feedback about that appointment by rating it from 1 ‚Äì 5

<img src="../master/images/connection.png" width = "500"/> 
</p>

3- Now open Schema.sql file in Database Files folder and execute it all. This will create the database and the tables. Afterwards execute the following sql files: Admin.sql, Doctor.sql, Patient.sql, Signup.sql.

4- Now execute the Insertions.sql file in Database Files folder. This will populate the database with some test entries. Moreover, some login emails and passwords of doctors, patients and admin are placed in the Insertions.sql file. You can use them to test the functionalities of the system.

5- Everything is setup now! You can run the Visual Studio Project by opening Clinic Management System.sln and then select the SignUp.aspx page and click run button named IIS Express.
